Keywords: Chatbot Iplementation: Core focus of this project. It is the implementation of a chatbot
          system. It needs development, programming, and use of chatbots to provide support to small 
          scale or even large scale business needs.

          Natural Language Processing(NLP): NLP is the fundamental element of this project. We need to
          use NLP techniques in python for chatbot development. NLP relates the processes involved in enabling
          chatbot to understand and respond to given data input and respond quieries accordingly.

          Small Business Solutions: The main aim of this project is to benefit small scale business solutions 
          considering the increase in number of customers and a lot queries asked by them, it is not possible 
          to provide solution to every customer with a company executive. So to reduce the cost, and to provide 
          quick service to custmers we are implementing this project.

Description: The project "Chatbot Implementation Project with NLP" strives to meet the need for small companies to communicate 
             with their consumers efficiently and immediately through the use of chatbots.Rather than investing in human customer 
             service teams, the project investigates the use of Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods in Python to create a Chatbot 
             system. This chatbot will be programmed to automatically interpret and react to user enquiries.
             
             Type of data to be analyzed in this project is text which represents user inputs for interaction.
             Categories: To differentiate between different kind of user queries.
             Answer field: Which contains reponse to user query.
             Possible questions:
             1.How can the chatbot be trained to respond wide range of user queries?
             2.What is the impact of chatbots on small-scale business efficiency?

Intellectual Merit: The scientific discovery potential of this project lies in advancing knowledge related to the implementation of NLP-based chatbot systems for small businesses.
                    While chatbots are becoming more widespread, personalizing and training them for unique organizations can result in fresh insights and strategies. The study may 
                    lead to the creation of more efficient and tailored chatbots that can improve consumer interactions and help businesses.

Data Sourcing: The dataset for this project is contained in a text file. It consists of three types of values: text, category, and answer. 
               The text represents user inputs for interacting with the chatbot, the category serves as labels to differentiate user queries, and the answer
               represents the chatbot's responses. The answers given by chatbot are results of inputs of data set from customer requirement.
               The methodology used for retrieving this data involves accessing the .txt file and parsing its contents.
               Therefore, this data can be used for analysis and model training as needed.

Background Knowledge: There are 3 major areas in which a person need to have knowledge understanding this project.
                      Natural Language Processing in Python (NLTK) Documentation:
                      Source weblink-  NLTK :: Natural Language Toolkit. (n.d.). https://www.nltk.org/
                      This official documentation provides detailed information on usage of NLTK library.
                      it clearly explains how to use the particular library in python, including
                      Tokenization,
                      Lemmatization,
                      Stemming,
                      and other NLP techniques needed for this project.
